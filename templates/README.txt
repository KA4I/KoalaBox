*** NOTE ***

Do NOT use the {{ config_filename }} file unless you have a good reason.
The default config file enables logging, which might have a negative impact on performance in games.
So, unless you really need to see logs for debugging issues, it is advised to either:
  disable logging in the config file by setting the "logging" field to false
or
  not use the {{ config_filename }} file at all.
